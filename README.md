# Portfolio-Evidence-ML

Welcome to the repository dedicated to my semester work! Here you will find projects corresponding to each assignment and presentation, including code, datasets, and related documents such as slides and PDF files.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

1. **Perceptron (U1)**
    - Perceptron implementation.
    - Solutions to common problems.
    - Detailed documentation.

2. **Expo (Dimensionality Reduction)**
    - Presentation on dimensionality reduction techniques.
    - Code related to the presentation.

3. **Predictor from Scratch**
    - Development of a predictor from scratch.
    - Used datasets.
    - Presentation files.

4. **Perceptron Implementation**
    - Another specific implementation of the perceptron, with an emphasis on different aspects.

5. **KNN Implementation**
    - Implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
    - Evaluation of its performance in different cases.

6. **Expo (Naive Bayes, SVM, DT)**
    - Presentation on popular algorithms: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees.
    - Associated codes and comparative analysis.

7. **Ensemble Research Task**
    - Research task on ensemble methods.
    - Document summarizing findings and conclusions.

8. **Final Project**
    - Initial definition of the project.
    - First submission (U2) with progress and preliminary results.
    - Final submission (U3) with the complete project and detailed analysis.
